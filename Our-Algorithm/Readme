# This folder contains the details of the code regarding the new algorithm proposed by us.

#The fields to be tested are present in the folder all-fields/

#The following things have to be done for testing purposes:

1. Modify the file field_now.m according to the field required.

2. Choose a value of k and test whether it is valid or not by running the file find-validity-of-k.m

3. Put proper values in threads-and-relations.sh according to the number of relations wanted

4. Get the factor base beow Bach bound by running magma factor-base-below-bach-bound-random-seq-writing.m

5. Run the pre-computation phase by: bash par-precomputing.sh

6. Fing walk length by running: magma find-walk-length.m

7. View the relation file by doing: bash view-relation-files.sh > out-view-relation-files.dat

8. View all relations in a single folder: mv out-view-relation-files.dat output_folder_relations/
